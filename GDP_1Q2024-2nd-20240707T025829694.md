## Gross Domestic Product (Second Estimate), Corporate Profits (Preliminary Estimate), First Quarter 2024

Real grossdomesticproduct (GDP) increased at anannual rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024 (table 1), according to the 'second ' estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the fourth quarter of 2023, real GDP increased 3.4 percent.

The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the 'advance ' estimate issued last month. In the advance estimate, the increase in real GDP was 1.6 percent. The update primarily reflected a downward revision to consumer spending (refer to 'Updates to GDP ').

The increase in real GDP primarily reflected increases in consumer spending, residential fixed investment, nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in private inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased (table 2).

Compared to the fourth quarter, the deceleration in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected decelerations in consumer spending, exports, and state and local government spending and a downturn in federal government spending. These movements were partly offset by an acceleration in residential fixed investment. Imports accelerated.

Current-dollar GDP increased 4.3 percent at an annual rate, or $298.9 billion, in the first quarter to a level of $28.26 trillion, a downward revision of $28.6 billion from the previous estimate (tables 1 and 3). More information on the source data that underlie the estimates is available in the 'Key Source Data and Assumptions ' file on BEA's website.

The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 3.0 percent in the first quarter, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point from the previous estimate. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 3.3 percent, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point. Excluding food and energy prices, the PCE price index increased 3.6 percent, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point.

## Personal Income

Current-dollar personal income increased $404.4 billion in the first quarter, a downward revision of $2.6 billion from the previous estimate. The increase in the first quarter primarily reflected increases in compensation (led by private wages and salaries) and personal current transfer receipts (led by government social benefits to persons) (table 8).

Disposable personal income increased $266.7 billion, or 5.3 percent, in the first quarter, an upward revision of $40.5 billion from the previous estimate. Real disposable personal income increased 1.9 percent, an upward revision of 0.8 percentage point.

Personal saving was $796.6 billion in the first quarter, an upward revision of $96.6 billion from the previous estimate. The personal saving rate personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income was 3.8 percent in the first quarter, an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point.

## Gross Domestic Income and Corporate Profits

Real gross domestic income (GDI) increased 1.5 percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 3.6 percent (revised) in the fourth quarter. The average of real GDP and real GDI, a supplemental measure of U.S. economic activity that equally weights GDP and GDI, increased 1.4 percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter (table 1).

Profits from current production (corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) decreased $21.1 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $133.5 billion in the fourth quarter (table 10).

Profits of domestic financialcorporations increased $73.7 billion in the first quarter, compared with an increase of $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Profits of domestic nonfinancial corporations decreased $114.1 billion, in contrast to an increase of $136.5 billion. Rest-of-the-world profits increased $19.3

billion, in contrast to a decrease of $8.9 billion. In the first quarter, receipts increased $29.8 billion, and payments increased $10.5 billion.

## Updates to GDP

With the second estimate, downward revisions to consumer spending, private inventory investment, and federal government spending were partly offset by upward revisions to state and local government spending, nonresidential fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and exports. Imports were revised up. For more information, refer to the Technical Note. For information on updates to GDP, refer to the 'Additional Information ' section that follows.

## Updates to Fourth-Quarter Wages and Salaries

In addition to presenting updated estimates for the first quarter, today's release presents revised estimates of fourth-quarter wages andsalaries, personal taxes, and contributions for government social insurance, based on updated data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program. Wages andsalaries are now estimated to have increased $58.5 billion in the fourth quarter, a downward revision of $73.0 billion. Personal current taxes are now estimated to have increased $27.1 billion, a downward revision of $12.6 billion. Contributions for government social insurance are now estimated to have increased $8.3 billion, a downward revision of $9.6 billion. With the incorporation of these new data, real gross domestic income is now estimated to have increased 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter, a downward revision of 1.2 percentage points from the previously published estimate.

## Definitions

Gross domestic product (GDP), or value added, is the value of the goods and services produced by the nation's economy less the value of the goods and services used up in production. GDP is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment.

Gross domestic income (GDI) is the sum of incomes earned and costs incurred in the production of GDP. In national economic accounting, GDP and GDI are conceptually equal. In practice, GDP and GDI differ because they are constructed using largely independent source data.

Gross output is the value of the goods and services produced by the nation's economy. It is principally measured using industry sales or receipts, including sales to final users (GDP) and sales to other industries (intermediate inputs).

Current-dollar estimates are valued in the prices of the period when the transactions occurred that is, at 'market value. ' Also referred to as 'nominal estimates ' or as 'current-price estimates. '

Real values are inflation-adjusted estimates that is, estimates that exclude the effects of price changes.

The gross domestic purchases price index measures the prices of final goods and services purchased by U.S. residents.

The personal consumption expenditure price index measures the prices paid for the goods and services purchased by, or on the behalf of, 'persons. '

Personal income is the income receivedby, or on behalf of, all persons from all sources: from participation as laborers in production, from owning a home or business, from the ownership of financial assets, and from government and business in the form of transfers. It includes income from domestic sources as well as the rest of world. It does not include realized or unrealized capital gains or losses.

Disposable personal income is the income available to persons for spending or saving. It is equal to personal income less personal current taxes.

Personal outlays is the sum of personal consumption expenditures, personal interest payments, and personal current transfer payments.

Personal saving is personal income less personal outlays and personal current taxes.

The personal saving rate is personal saving as a percentage of disposable personal income.

Profits from current production, referred to as corporate profits with inventory valuation adjustment (IVA) and capital consumption (CCAdj) adjustment in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs), is a measure of the net income of corporations before deducting income taxes that is consistent with the value of goods and services measured in GDP. The IVA and CCAdj are adjustments that convert inventory withdrawals and depreciation of fixed assets reported on a tax-return, historical-cost basis to the current-cost economic measures used in the national income and product accounts. Profits for domestic industries reflect profits for all corporations located within the geographic borders of the United States. The rest-ofthe-world (ROW) component of profits is measured as the difference between profits received from ROW and profits paid to ROW.

For more definitions, refer to the Glossary: National Income and Product Accounts.

## Statistical conventions

Annual-vs-quarterly rates. Quarterly seasonally adjusted values are expressed at annual rates, unless otherwise specified. This convention is used for BEA's featured, seasonally adjusted measures to facilitate comparisons with related and historical data. For details, refer tothe FAQ ' Why does BEA publish estimates at annual rates? '

Quarterly not seasonally adjusted values are expressed only at quarterly rates.

Percent changes. Percent changes in quarterly seasonally adjusted series are displayed at annual rates, unless otherwise specified. For details, refer to the FAQ ' How is average annual growth calculated ?' and ' Why does BEA publish percent changes in quarterly series at annual rates? ' Percent changes in quarterly not seasonally adjusted values are calculated from the same quarter one year ago. All published percent changes are calculated from unrounded data.

Calendar years and quarters. Unless noted otherwise, annual and quarterly data are presented on a calendar basis.

Quantities and prices. Quantities, or 'real ' volume measures, and prices are expressed as index numbers with a specified reference year equal to 100 (currently 2017). Quantity and price indexes are calculated using a Fisherchained weighted formula that incorporates weights from two adjacent periods (quarters for quarterly data and annuals for annual data). For details on the calculation of quantity and price indexes, refer to Chapter 4: Estimating Methods in the NIPA Handbook.

Chained-dollar values are calculated by multiplying the quantity index by the current dollar value in the reference year (2017) and then dividing by 100. Percent changes calculated from real quantity indexes and chained-dollar levels are conceptually the same; any differences are due to rounding. Chained-dollar values are not additive because the relative weights for a given period differ from those of the reference year. In tables that display chained-dollar values, a 'residual ' line shows the difference between the sum of detailed chained-dollar series and its corresponding aggregate.

## Updates to GDP

BEA releases three vintages of the current quarterly estimate for GDP. 'Advance ' estimates are released near the end of the first month following the end of the quarter and are based on source data that are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency. 'Second ' and 'third ' estimates are released near the end of the second and third months, respectively, and are based on more detailed and more comprehensive data as they become available.

The table below shows the average revisions to the quarterly percent changes in real GDP between different estimate vintages, without regard to sign.

| Vintage           |   Average Revision  Without Regard to Sign  (percentage points, annual rates) |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Advance to second |                                                                           0.5 |
| Advance to third  |                                                                           0.6 |
| Second to third   |                                                                           0.3 |

Note-Based on estimates from 1996 through 2022. For more information on GDP updates, refer to Revision Information on the BEA website.

Annual and comprehensive updates are released in late September. Annual updates generally cover at least the five most recent calendar years (and their associated quarters) and incorporate newly available major annual source data as well as some changes in methods and definitions to improve the accounts. Comprehensive (or benchmark) updates are carried out at about 5-year intervals and incorporate major periodic source data, as well as major conceptual improvements.

Unlike GDP, advance current quarterly estimates of GDI and corporate profits are not released because data on domestic profits and net interest of domestic industries are not available. For fourth quarter estimates, these data are not available until the third estimate.

GDP by industry and gross output estimates are released with the third estimate of GDP.
